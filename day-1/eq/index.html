<p>In this post, I have listed the tools for ReactJS that I found to be very useful. My selection criteria was the frequency of development, newly added features etc.<p/>

<h2>ReactN</h2>

<p>ReactN is an extension of React that includes global state management. It treats global state as if it were built into React itself — without the boilerplate of third party libraries.</p>

<h2>Reactotron</h2>

<p>An app for inspecting your React JS and React Native projects. macOS, Linux, and Windows.<p>

<h2>Spectacle <h2>

<p>A ReactJS based library for creating sleek presentations using JSX syntax that gives you the ability to live demo your code.<p>

<h2>React toastify</h2>

<p>A toast for all of us and our web apps. React-Toastify allow you to add notification to your app with ease. No more nonsense!<p>

<h2>React Draft WYSIWYG</h2>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love Draft.js – it’s simple and most importantly customizable.

But then wouldn’t you love a great work done by a fellow developer on top of Draft.js with 100s of options? I am talking emoji and hashtags :)
